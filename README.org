* Overview

=pomo-cat.el= is a simple yet charming Pomodoro timer for Emacs.
Unlike many existing Pomodoro packages that rely on notifications,
mode-line displays, or logging, =pomo-cat= places an adorable cat in the center
of your screen during breaks—either as an image or ASCII art.

This playful approach helps you *visually recognize rest periods* and avoid
overworking or skipping breaks due to overlooked alerts or distraction by timers.

* Motivation

Most existing Pomodoro timers for Emacs focus on features like:

- Desktop or mode-line notifications
- Logging work/break times
- Progress indicators

However, in actual use, we found:

- Notifications are easy to miss—especially when deeply focused.
- Mode-line timers divert attention unnecessarily.
- Logs are rarely reviewed.

Hence, the need for a *visually engaging and unmistakable break indicator*.
This package was born to show a cat in the center of the screen during breaks,
reminding you to truly “take a break.”

* Features

- Pomodoro timer with customizable durations
- Displays a centered cat using:
  - An image (on GUI Emacs via `posframe`)
  - ASCII art (on terminal or fallback)
- Supports both short and long breaks
- Lightweight and minimal, no persistent logging

* Installation

The package is available on MELPA. Dependencies include ~posframe~ and ~popon~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package pomo-cat
    :ensure t)
#+end_src

* Usage

Start the timer:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  M-x pomo-cat-start
#+end_src

Stop the timer and hide the cat:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  M-x pomo-cat-stop
#+end_src

* Customization

Use =M-x customize-group RET pomo-cat RET= or set variables directly in your init file.

- `pomo-cat-work-duration-seconds` ::
  Duration of a single Pomodoro work session, in seconds.
  Default is 1500 seconds (25 minutes).
  You can set it to a shorter value for testing, e.g.:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq pomo-cat-work-duration-seconds 60) ;; 1 minute work session
  #+end_src

- `pomo-cat-break-duration-seconds` ::
  Duration of a short break after each work session, in seconds.
  Default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
  These short breaks occur after each work cycle except the last one before a long break.

- `pomo-cat-long-break-duration-seconds` ::
  Duration of a long break (after multiple cycles), in seconds.
  Default is 1200 seconds (20 minutes).
  Useful for deeper rest after completing several Pomodoros.

- `pomo-cat-cycles-before-long-break` ::
  Number of completed Pomodoro cycles before a long break is triggered.
  Default is 4.
  For example, with the default setting:
  - You’ll work 4 times for 25 minutes
  - Take 3 short breaks
  - And then take a long break after the 4th cycle

- `pomo-cat-cat-image-path` ::
  File path to a cat image (e.g., PNG) to display during breaks in GUI Emacs.
  If this is nil or the image doesn't exist, ASCII art will be shown instead.
  Example:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq pomo-cat-cat-image-path "~/Pictures/cats/cute-cat.png")
  #+end_src

- `pomo-cat-display-method` ::
  Method used to show the cat on screen.
  Available options:
  - `'popon` (default) :: Uses `popon` for terminal-based (TTY) popup display.
  - `'posframe` :: Uses `posframe` to display the cat in a floating child frame (GUI only).
  The display method automatically falls back to ASCII in message area if both methods are unavailable.

- `pomo-cat-ascii-cat` ::
  A string of ASCII art to show when a cat image is not used or unavailable.
  You can replace it with your own ASCII art:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq pomo-cat-ascii-cat " (=^･ω･^=) Take a break!")
  #+end_src
